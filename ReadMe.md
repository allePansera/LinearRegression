# ML LinearRegression Intercept Term

Linear regression model with hyp under intercept form.

Hypotesis function is defined as: $$h_0(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} x_i*\theta_i$$


Loss function is defined as 'Least Squares': $$L(\theta) = \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} (h_0(x_i) - y_i)^2 $$


Implemented method for convex, BGD and SGD parameter optimized research
